# 🧮 Scientific GUI Calculator using Tkinter

This project is a Python-based scientific calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the **Tkinter** library. It demonstrates how to use Python’s built-in tools to create functional and user-friendly desktop applications.

## 📌 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to showcase the use of the `tkinter` library to build a fully functional **scientific calculator GUI**. It includes both standard arithmetic operations and scientific functions such as square root, logarithms, and trigonometry.

## ✨ Features

- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`, `(`, `)`
- Decimal and clear functionality
- Scientific functions:
  - Square root (`√`)
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
- Responsive and easy-to-use interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **GUI Library:** Tkinter
- **Math Module:** Python’s built-in `math`

## 🚀 Getting Started
